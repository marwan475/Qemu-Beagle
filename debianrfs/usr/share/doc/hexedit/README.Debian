The following issue was fixed in Debian. However, I will keep this README file

hexedit is truncating the address in first line when running over some
terminals. See an example below:

0   46 6F 72 6D  61 74 3A 20  68 74 74 70  73 3A 2F 2F  77 77 77 2E  64 65 62 69  Format: https://www.debi

00000030   75 61 6C 73  2F 63 6F 70  79 72 69 67  68 74 2D 66  6F 72 6D 61  74 2F 31 2E  uals/copyright-format/1.
00000048   30 2F 0A 55  70 73 74 72  65 61 6D 2D  4E 61 6D 65  3A 20 68 65  78 65 64 69  0/.Upstream-Name: hexedi

There is a opened bug about it opened in Debian (#909963) and here[1]. As a
workaround, you can set a terminal when starting hexedit, as shown below:

  $ TERM=linux hexedit file.txt

or

  $ TERM=rxvt hexedit file.txt

However, this procedure maybe allow no edit the opened file.
