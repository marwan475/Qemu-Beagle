live-boot in Debian
===================

Regressions
-----------

During the squeeze release cycle, live-initramfs was splitted into live-boot
(early userspace) and live-config (late userspace). This allowed to rewrite the
late userspace code in a better way and gain a lot of speed improvement at the
same time.

However, as with every rewrite, there are a few regressions. Compared to lennys
live-initramfs version 1.x, live-boot and live-config version 2.x of squeeze
have to following known bugs:

  * no serial console support during booting.

  * the locale script doesn't automatically configures the keyboard when a
    'short' locale is specified (like locales=de).

All of these bugs will be fixed at some point during the squeeze+1 release
cycle. Since live-boot and live-config version 3.x will contain legacy support
for squeeze, upgrading to the next generation will be pretty painless.
